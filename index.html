            <h3>Rome, the “Eternal City”</h3>
            <p>
              Rome brims with ancient history, from the Colosseum to the port of Ostia Antica to majestic Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel. Because of its history, art, architecture, and beauty – and perhaps its gelato and pasta! – Rome is one of our most popular cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              With its rich history and gorgeous architecture, breathtaking churches, fountains, and piazzas it has something for everyone. Whether you are looking for delicious food, fabulous shopping, or exciting entertainment, you will find it all in Rome.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Cynthia and I've been to Rome only once, but it was more than enough to make me fall inlove with it. I created this page as part of a
              project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills and, who knows? maybe you'll fall in love with Rome too.
